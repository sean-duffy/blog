	<h2 class='noLink'>About</h2>
	<p>
		I'm <strong>Sean</strong>. Originally from Liverpool, I'm a software developer at Morgan Stanley in London.
		I have a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science from the University of York.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm interested in programming, electronics and more.
		You can see examples of some things I've made on the <a href='/projects/'>projects</a> page and on my
		<a href='http://www.github.com/sean-duffy' target='_blank'>GitHub profile</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a small collection of vintage computers, which you can see and read about in
		<a href='/2013/07/15/vintage-computer-collection/'>this</a>
		post. I also have an affection for all things that fly under remote control, mostly quadcopters,
		and I like building and flying them in my spare time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides that I also play the guitar or occasionally piano.
		I like to read classic science fiction and fantasy as well as biographies and historical books.
